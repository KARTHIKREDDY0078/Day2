Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
ANS:
    A data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold in a programming language. It defines the operations that can be performed on the data, as well as the way it is stored in memory.

-------Primitive Data Types------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primitive data types are the most basic types of data that are directly supported by a programming language. They are not made up of other data types and are typically mapped directly to machine-level instructions. These data types serve as the foundation for storing values in programming.

***** some common primitive data types with examples:*********

1)Integer (int):
Represents whole numbers.
Example: x = 10

2)Floating-Point (float):
Represents numbers with fractional parts (decimals).
Example: y = 3.14

3)Character (char):
Represents a single character or symbol.
Example: char letter = 'A';

4)Boolean (bool):
Represents two possible values: true or false.
Example: isStudent = true;

5)Byte:
A small unit of storage, usually 8 bits, capable of storing values from 0 to 255.
Example: byte age = 25;

---NON-Primitive Data Types------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-primitive data types are more complex and usually represent collections or more structured data. These types are built from primitive types and may hold a reference to the data stored in memory.
******Common Non-Primitive Data Types:****
1.Arrays
An array is a collection of elements, all of which are of the same type. Arrays can store multiple values, accessed by an index.
Example:
 		 int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

2.Strings (in languages where strings are not primitive types)
A string is an object that stores a sequence of characters, and can have more functionality (e.g., methods for manipulating text).
Example: 
 	 	  String name = "Alice";

3.Classes/Objects
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes and can contain both data and methods.
     Example:
					class Car {
    						String model;
    						int year;
    						Car(String model, int year) {
        						this.model = model;
       							this.year = year;
    						}
					}
					Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2020);

4.Lists/Collections (like ArrayList, LinkedList):
These are data structures that store multiple values or objects and can be resized or modified dynamically.
Example (in Java):
		 ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();

5.Dictionaries/Maps:
A map (or dictionary) is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value.
Example (in Python): 
		dict person = {"name": "John", "age": 30};

6.Sets
A set is a collection that stores unique values (no duplicates).
Example:
		 Set<String> uniqueNames = new HashSet<String>();
