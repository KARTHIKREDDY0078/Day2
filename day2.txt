Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
ANS:
    A data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold in a programming language. It defines the operations that can be performed on the data, as well as the way it is stored in memory.

Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the most basic types of data that are directly supported by a programming language. They are not made up of other data types and are typically mapped directly to machine-level instructions. These data types serve as the foundation for storing values in programming.

Here are some common primitive data types with examples:

Integer (int):

Represents whole numbers.
Example: x = 10
Floating-Point (float):

Represents numbers with fractional parts (decimals).
Example: y = 3.14
Character (char):

Represents a single character or symbol.
Example: char letter = 'A';
Boolean (bool):

Represents two possible values: true or false.
Example: isStudent = true;
String (sometimes considered primitive in some languages, but treated as an object in others like Java or Python):

Represents a sequence of characters (words or phrases).
Example: name = "Alice"
Byte:

A small unit of storage, usually 8 bits, capable of storing values from 0 to 255.
Example: byte age = 25;
